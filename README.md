Scripts I personally use to do all my processing. There is no script to do the upload directly to any platform due to me preferring to do the upload manually. Slows me down, but lets me spot mistakes easily.

## Picard Rename Script

Made to comply with FNP music upload guidelines. Can be destructive, be careful! 

### Usage

1. [Download the script](https://github.com/nicfein/reimagined-octo/blob/main/FnP%20Music%20Upload%20Standard.ptsp).
2. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + S`.
3. Go to `File`, and `Import A Script File`.
4. Select the downloaded script.
5. Once added, select the script in the wide dropdown.
6. Press `Make it so!`, and in the toolbar go to `Options`, and enable `Rename Files` and `Move Files`
7. Now when you save your files, they will save like so: `/storage/Ken Carson/XTENDED (2022) - 24bit 44.1kHz/1-01 - Intro.flac`
